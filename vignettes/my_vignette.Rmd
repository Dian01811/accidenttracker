List of Changes to US_Accidents Data Set
---
- Filtered all of the data to only include points from the year 2019.

- Column names were changed in order to be in compliance with the style guide for MICR 475.
  - The names for each column were changed to the proper forms of snake case. 

- Missing values were removed from the data set via the 'dplyr::filter' command.

- Information pertaining to weather data was originally spread over numerous smaller columns. 
  - Specific weather conditions, such as "Fair" and "Heavy Rain", were categorized into broader weather descriptions in a new column. 
  - Conditions directly related to "Rain", "Snow", "Windy", etc. were grouped together for ease of visual and graphical interpretation 
  

Select Input and Select Options
---
- select_input
  - Utilizes an if loop to generate a shiny widget which allows users to select different types of inputs.. Examples of these include multiple check boxes, single option select, or multiple option select.  
  
- select_options
  - This function exists to generate a unique character vector from a selected column when viewing the data through the shiny app. 
  


Histogram Plot
---
The function histogram_plot switches the displayed graph between a bar graph or a histogram depending on the variable plotted on the x-axis. This allows for certain variables and relationships to be more easily interpreted displayed. 

- The variables "state", "day.night", "wind.dir", "side", "month", and "hour" all plot as a bar graph. 

- Any other variable selected in the shinyapp will be displayed on a histogram instead. 



Color pal, Color data, Legend Title
---
These three functions are UI functions and are designed to alter certain characteristics of the user interface for the shinyapp.

- The color scheme of the map and legend are adjusted depending on the selected input variable, whether it be temperature, day/night, etc.
